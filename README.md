# ðŸš€ Always Code

> A personal journey to sharpen my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** skills through **daily coding** and **real-life problem implementations** â€” built and tested in **VS Code**.

## ðŸ§© About This Repository

**Always Code** is a living repository that grows daily.  
Every day, I pick a **new DSA concept**, understand it deeply, and implement it both in a **theoretical** and a **real-world** context.

I believe that coding DSA with relatable examples not only strengthens problem-solving skills but also builds practical intuition.

## ðŸ’¡ Real-Life Implementations

Each topic includes a real-life connection:

| DSA Concept | Real-Life Example |
|--------------|------------------|
| Array | Managing student roll numbers in order |
| Stack | Undo/Redo in text editors |
| Queue | Ticket booking or printer queue |
| Linked List | Music playlist navigation |
| Tree | File directory structure |
| Graph | Social network connections |
| Sorting | Sorting leaderboard scores |
| Searching | Finding a name in a contact list |
